        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all the ingredients
            </li>
            <li>
                In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, large slice of onion, 
                garlic cloves, and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and gently boil for about 
                20 minutes to blend all of the flavors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. 
                Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to 
                make a roux, cooking until the roux is a medium brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so that no lumps form, then stir in the rest.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve hot and enjoy!
